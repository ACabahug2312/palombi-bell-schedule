# palombi-bell-schedule
This program helps students of Peter J. Palombi Middle School be
able to tell when the bell is going to ring. This program can be 
included in websites such as Google Sites as an embed file. Note
that not all middle schools use the same schedule as Palombi.

Update 8/25/20: This is not for remote learning but I will be
creating a customizable bell schedule that can be used for
different schools.
